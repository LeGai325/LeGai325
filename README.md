### Hi there 👋

I am Le Gai, a graduate of the School of Cyber Engineering, **Xidian University**, where I majored in Network Engineering. I was a member of **XDSEC**(2022) and a pwn player in the CTF.

I am now pursuing my **PhD program** at the Institute for Network Sciences and Cyberspace(INSC), **Tsinghua University**. I am a member of the [Network Architecture and Measurement Group](https://thuname.github.io/lab-website/), advised by **Assistant Research Professor Lin He**, and under the leadership of  **Prof. Ying Liu.**
